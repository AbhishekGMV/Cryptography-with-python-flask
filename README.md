# Cryptography-with-python-flask
A simple web application built using flask framework to implement Caesar cipher algorithm concept for encryption and decryption. <br><br>

### Description <br>
This web application deals with encryption and decryption operations using caesar cipher alogorithm (cryptography). <br>
Both encryption and decryption operation takes two inputs each, a text and a key. Text must be string and Key must be an integer.  <br>
Each character in the given string is shifted by key number of position to the right, with respect to alphabets.  <br><br>

### Tech Stack used <br>
[FLASK framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/). <br>
[BOOTSTRAP](https://getbootstrap.com/). <br><br>

### Instructions to run the program <br>
• Clone or download this repo locally. <br>
• Run the CaesarCipher.py script and open [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) in browser(Port number may vary). <br>
• Select either encryption or decryption to be performed and provide inputs respectively.
